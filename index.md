After a master's degree in particle physics and cosmology at the University Grenoble-Alpes, I am currently a PHD student at the Institut de recherche en astrophysique et planétologie (IRAP) in Toulouse since 2020. 

My research interests are centered on observational cosmology, gravitation theory and galactic astrophysics.

I am teaching assistant in several fields as point mechanics, thermodynamics and astrophysics at Université Paul Sabatier.

On my free time, I am also studying philosophy of science and differential geometry.

You can find here my full [CV](CV/CV_PHD.pdf).
