After a master degree in particle physics and cosmology at the University Grenoble-Alpes, I am currently a PHD student at the Institut de recherche en astrophysique et planétologie (IRAP) in Toulouse since 2020. 

My research interests are centered on observational cosmology. On the one hand I am working on the analysis of large scale astrophysical signals from CMB missions. And I am also testing models implying a violation of the Einstein Equivalence principle and varying constants.

I am teaching several fields as mechanics, thermodynamics and astrophysics at Université Paul Sabatier.

On my free time, I am also studying philosophy of science and differential geometry.
