After a [master's degree](https://master-physique.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/le-programme/master-psc/) in particle physics and cosmology at the University Grenoble-Alpes, I am currently a PHD student at the Institut de recherche en astrophysique et planétologie ([IRAP](https://www.irap.omp.eu)) in Toulouse since 2020. 

My research interests are centered on observational cosmology, gravitation theory and galactic astrophysics.

I am teaching assistant in several fields as point mechanics, thermodynamics and astrophysics at Université Paul Sabatier.

On my free time, I am also studying philosophy of science and differential geometry.

You can find here my full [CV](CV/CV_PHD.pdf) and my publications on [scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uLb6OyYAAAAJ&hl=fr&authuser=1), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/search/astro-ph?searchtype=author&query=Vacher%2C+L), [inspire](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1969120?ui-citation-summary=true) or [researchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leo-Vacher).
